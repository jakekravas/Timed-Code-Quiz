# Timed Code Quiz

The purpose of this project was to create a timed, multiple choice quiz that asked the user five different questions about JavaScript and give them their score at the end of it. Every time a user answers a question correctly, they gain 100 points. Every time they guess incorrectly, they gain none. If the user finishes with time to spare, they'll gain whatever remaining seconds are on the clock towards their score, as long as they've answered at least one question correctly. The app looks into local storage and will display whoever holds the highest score on the "High Score" page.
